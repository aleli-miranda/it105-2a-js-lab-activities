Question 1: Create an object that describes a train ticket and 
store it in the ticket variable. The object must have three fields:

-starting station (key name from, give the name of the nearest station in your area as a value);
-end station (key name to, give any other station within 100km as a value);
-the price of the ticket (key name price, give the amount you would like to pay for this ticket as a value).

The object must be created using curly brackets, 
in which all created fields will be listed immediately. 
Then display the values of all fields of the ticket on the console.

//start code here
let ticket = {
  from: "Central Station",
  to: "North Station",
  price: 25
};
// Display the values of all fields of the ticket on the console
console.log("From:", ticket.from);
console.log("To:", ticket.to);
console.log("Price:", ticket.price);

/*Question 2: 
Declare an empty object and save it to a person variable. 
Using dot notation, add the name and surname fields to the 
object by entering your data as values. 
Try to display the individual fields on the console. */
// Question 2: Declare an empty object and add name and surname fields
let person = {};
// Using dot notation, add the name and surname fields
person.name = "John";
person.surname = "Doe";
// Display the individual fields on the console
console.log("Name:", person.name);
console.log("Surname:", person.surname);
